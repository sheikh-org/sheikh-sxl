## ⚡ Scaling & Plans

**sheikh-sxl** grows with you — from quick coding fixes to full-scale, multi-agent development pipelines.
Choose the plan that fits your **speed**, **throughput**, and **model access** requirements.

| Plan | Ideal For | Features |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Quick Fix** | Small scripts, bug fixes, one-off tasks | Local-only mode, synchronous execution, single-agent reasoning |
| **Pro Dev** | Medium projects & modules | Async execution, multi-tool support, Interleaved Thinking enabled |
| **Team / Multi-Agent** | Large-scale automation, complex pipelines | Fully async multi-agent orchestration, concurrent tool use, high-throughput model access |
| **Enterprise / Ultimate** | Massive workloads, edge + cloud hybrid | Priority model access, sandbox scaling, persistent memory, advanced tool orchestration |

> The model automatically **adapts reasoning speed** and resource usage depending on the complexity of your task, so whether it’s a quick code snippet or a multi-agent workflow, `sheikh-sxl` handles it seamlessly.
