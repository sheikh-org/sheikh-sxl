# Todo List for Model Preparation, Optimization, and Scaling

## 1. Model Preparation
- **Data Collection**  
  - Gather relevant datasets  
  - Ensure data diversity and quality  
- **Data Cleaning**  
  - Remove duplicate entries  
  - Handle missing values  
  - Normalize/standardize data as necessary  
- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Identify key features  
  - Create new features from existing data  
- **Model Selection**  
  - Research suitable algorithms  
  - Select preliminary models for testing  

## 2. Model Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
  - Define baseline hyperparameters  
  - Use grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization for tuning  
- **Model Evaluation**  
  - Define metrics for performance  
  - Perform cross-validation  
  - Evaluate model on validation datasets  
- **Implementation of Ensemble Methods**  
  - Explore ensemble techniques like bagging and boosting  

## 3. Scaling
- **Infrastructure Setup**  
  - Assess and provision necessary computational resources  
  - Consider using cloud solutions for scalability  
- **Model Deployment**  
  - Create pipelines for seamless integration  
  - Automate deployment processes  
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**  
  - Set up monitoring for model performance post-deployment  
  - Plan for periodic retraining with new data  

## 4. Review and Refinement
- **Team Review**  
  - Schedule reviews of progress with the team  
  - Iterate on feedback to refine models and processes
